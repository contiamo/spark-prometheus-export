# Exporter test

The `parse.py` validates that the metrics generated by the exporter are valid. It uses the `prometheus_client` library to parse the `metrics.txt` file. The parsed metrics are then printed to stdout.

This is intended as an example end-to-end test for manual validation.

The tests are run via Docker and can be executed with the following command:

```sh
bash run.sh
```
